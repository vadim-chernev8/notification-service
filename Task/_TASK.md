# Notification dashboard

Your task is to develop a dashboard for notifications. Notifications can be initially queried (paginated) and new notifications will be received via push. 

- As a user, I want to see all notifications in a list
- As a user, I want to delete notifications
- As a user, I want to publish new notifications
- As a user, I want to get notified when new notifications arrive (which I've not sent)
- As a user, I want to get notified about errors which cannot be retried

## Task

- Design and develop a (web) user interface that implements (at least) the given requirements in **production-ready** quality.
- Use appropriate state management which works across multiple pages/components.
- Use the provided mocked service.
- Use technologies, frameworks, component libraries, etc. of your choice.
- The language shall be TypeScript.
- Extensions are welcome but not necessary.
- Don't modify the mock service unless there are bugs.
